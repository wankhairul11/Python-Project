# Python Code Snippets
A collection of Python scripts showcasing various programming concepts including 
conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures. These snippets demonstrate 
basic operations and manipulations with different types of data.

# Program Description: Python Code Snippets

## Overview
This document provides summaries of Python code snippets designed to illustrate 
fundamental programming concepts. The scripts cover various operations such as 
checking numbers, handling loops, and working with data structures like lists, 
tuples, sets, and dictionaries. These examples are ideal for beginners to understand 
basic Python functionalities.

## Key Features

### Basic Operations
- **Even or Odd Check**: Determines if a given integer is even or odd, providing a 
  clear output based on the input number.
- **Multiplication Table**: Generates and prints the multiplication table for a 
  user-provided number, demonstrating basic iteration.

### User Input and Conditions
- **Largest of Three Numbers**: Takes three numbers as input and prints the largest, 
  showcasing conditional logic.
- **Count Vowels in a String**: Counts the vowels in a given string and prints the 
  result, illustrating string manipulation and iteration.

### Functions
- **Greeting Functions**: Includes functions to print custom greetings with optional 
  arguments, demonstrating function definitions and default parameters.
- **Sum Function**: A simple function that returns the sum of two numbers, illustrating 
  basic arithmetic operations in functions.

### Data Structures and Manipulations
- **List Operations**: Shows how to manipulate lists by adding, removing, and sorting 
  elements, demonstrating list methods and sorting.
- **Tuple Operations**: Demonstrates tuple creation, unpacking, and immutability, 
  highlighting tuple properties and operations.
- **Set Operations**: Covers set creation, additions, and various set operations like 
  intersection, union, and difference, along with membership checks.
- **Dictionary Operations**: Shows how to create, update, and iterate over dictionaries, 
  including adding and removing items and printing key-value pairs.

### Loops and Control Flow
- **Loop with Break Statement**: Prints numbers from 1 to 10 and stops when reaching 
  a specific number, illustrating loop control with the `break` statement.
- **Loop with Continue Statement**: Prints numbers from 1 to 10 while skipping multiples 
  of 3, demonstrating loop control with the `continue` statement.

## Technical Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python

## Usage
- **Check Even or Odd**: Set the `number` variable and run the script to check if 
  it's even or odd.
- **Generate Multiplication Table**: Enter a number when prompted to see the 
  multiplication results from 1 to 12.
- **Find Largest Number**: Input three numbers to find and display the largest.
- **Count Vowels**: Enter a string to get the count of vowels within it.
- **Function Examples**: Use the provided functions to see different functionalities 
  like greetings and summing numbers.
- **Data Structure Manipulations**: Modify and observe operations on lists, tuples, 
  sets, and dictionaries.
- **Control Flow Examples**: Experiment with loops and control statements to understand 
  their impact.

These Python code snippets are designed to help learners and developers practice basic 
programming concepts and operations in Python.
