# Python-Project-
a collection of simple application using Python


Summary
1. Check Even or Odd Number
This script takes an integer value (number = 7), checks if the number is even or odd, and prints the result. For the given example,
the output is "The number is odd."

3. Multiplication Table
The script prompts the user to enter a number and then prints the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 12. The output will
display the results of multiplying the user-provided number by each integer in the range.

5. Find the Largest Number
This script takes three numbers as input from the user and prints the largest of the three. For the provided input (12, 25, 7), the
output is "The largest number of the series is: 25."

7. Count Vowels in a String
The script counts the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in a given string input by the user and prints the count. For the input
"Hello World", the output is "The number of vowels in 'Hello World' is 3."

9. Functions and Arguments
greet_user(name): Prints a greeting message including the provided name.
greet_user(name, greeting="Hello"): Prints a custom greeting message with a default greeting of "Hello."
sum_numbers(a, b): Returns the sum of two numbers a and b. For inputs 5 and 10, the output is 15.
10. List Operations
List Manipulation: Performs operations on a list of fruits: appends "elderberry", removes "banana", inserts "blueberry" at the
second position, and sorts the list alphabetically. The final list is ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry'].
12. Loop with Break Statement
The script prints numbers from 1 to 10 but breaks the loop when the number is 7. The output is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

13. Loop with Continue Statement
The script prints numbers from 1 to 10, skipping multiples of 3. The output is 1 2 4 5 7 8 10.

14. Tuples
Tuple Creation: Creates a tuple of fruits and prints the first and last elements. Output is apple, date.
Tuple Unpacking: Unpacks a tuple of numbers and prints the first two elements and the remaining elements. Output is 1 2 [3, 4, 5].
Tuple Immutability: Attempts to change an element in a tuple and catches the TypeError, printing a message about tuple immutability.
15. Sets
Set Creation: Creates a set of colors and adds "purple" to it.
Set Operations: Finds the intersection, union, and difference between two sets (colors and primary_colors). Outputs are:
Intersection: {'red', 'blue', 'yellow'}
Union: {'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'green', 'purple'}
Difference: {'purple', 'green'}
Set Membership: Checks if "green" is in primary_colors and if "orange" is not in colors. Outputs are:
False for "green"
True for "orange"
16. Dictionaries
Creating Dictionaries: Initializes a dictionary with student grades and prints Bob's grade. Output is 90.
Dictionary Operations: Updates the dictionary by adding a new student, updating an existing grade, and removing an entry.
The final dictionary is {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 90, 'Diana': 92, 'Eve': 88}.
Looping Through a Dictionary: Loops through the dictionary and prints each student's name and grade. Outputs:
Student: Alice, Grade: 95
Student: Bob, Grade: 90
Student: Diana, Grade: 92
Student: Eve, Grade: 88
