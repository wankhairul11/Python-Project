Python Code Snippets
This document provides summaries for various Python code snippets, demonstrating different programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and data structures.

Code Summaries
1. Check Even or Odd Number
Description: Determines whether a given integer is even or odd. Usage: The script checks the value of number (e.g., 7) and prints whether it's even or odd. Output: "The number is odd."

2. Multiplication Table
Description: Generates a multiplication table for a user-provided number. Usage: Prompts the user for a number and prints the multiplication results from 1 to 12. Output: Displays the multiplication results in the format "number x i = result."

3. Find the Largest Number
Description: Identifies the largest of three user-input numbers. Usage: Takes three numbers as input and prints the largest one. Example Input: 12, 25, 7 Output: "The largest number of the series is: 25."

4. Count Vowels in a String
Description: Counts the number of vowels in a given string. Usage: Prompts the user for a string and prints the count of vowels. Example Input: "Hello World" Output: "The number of vowels in 'Hello World' is 3."

5. Functions and Arguments
Description: Demonstrates various functions and their arguments.

greet_user(name): Prints a greeting with the provided name.
greet_user(name, greeting="Hello"): Prints a custom greeting.
sum_numbers(a, b): Returns the sum of two numbers.
Example Outputs:

"Greetings, John!"
"Hello, Bobo!"
For inputs 5 and 10: 15
6. List Operations
Description: Performs operations on a list of fruits. Usage: Adds "elderberry", removes "banana", inserts "blueberry", and sorts the list. Output: ['apple', 'blueberry', 'cherry', 'date', 'elderberry']

7. Loop with Break Statement
Description: Prints numbers from 1 to 10 and stops when reaching 7. Output: Prints numbers 1 2 3 4 5 6 and "Breaking the loop."

8. Loop with Continue Statement
Description: Prints numbers from 1 to 10, skipping multiples of 3. Output: Prints numbers 1 2 4 5 7 8 10.

9. Tuples
Description: Demonstrates tuple operations including creation, unpacking, and immutability.

Creation: Prints the first and last elements of a tuple.
Unpacking: Shows the result of unpacking a tuple into variables.
Immutability: Attempts to modify a tuple and catches the TypeError.
Example Outputs:

Tuple elements: apple, date
Unpacked values: 1 2 [3, 4, 5]
Error message: "Tuples are immutable, so you can't change their elements."
10. Sets
Description: Covers set operations including creation, addition, and set operations (intersection, union, difference). Usage: Demonstrates set manipulations and membership checks. Example Outputs:

Intersection: {'red', 'blue', 'yellow'}
Union: {'red', 'yellow', 'blue', 'green', 'purple'}
Difference: {'purple', 'green'}
Membership: False for "green", True for "orange".
11. Dictionaries
Description: Shows dictionary operations including creation, updating, and iteration. Usage: Manages student grades, updates records, and prints student information. Example Outputs:

Bob's grade: 90
Updated dictionary: {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 90, 'Diana': 92, 'Eve': 88}
Iterated entries:
"Student: Alice, Grade: 95"
"Student: Bob, Grade: 90"
"Student: Diana, Grade: 92"
"Student: Eve, Grade: 88"
